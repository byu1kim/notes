print string

print("Hello world")
```

##### variable

Variables are stored in memory (?)
Python read code from top to bottom, if you change the varaible at the end, it will take the latest code

```
a = 2
b = 3
print(a+b)
```

name convention : my_age (snake case), not starting with number

#### Data types

string

```python
my_name = "text"
```

boolean

```python
a = True
b = False
```
